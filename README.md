Company Network Design Project
Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a comprehensive network for a company using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network was created to support multiple departments, including Marketing, R&D, and Distributors, and includes various network devices such as routers, switches, and PCs. The project focuses on creating a secure, efficient, and scalable network infrastructure.

Features
Network Design: Complete network design from scratch tailored for Marketing, R&D, and Distributor departments.
Devices Used: Routers, switches, and PCs.
IP Management: Configured DHCP and DNS servers for dynamic IP allocation and domain resolution.
Security Measures: Implemented various security measures to protect network resources.
Subnetting: Applied subnetting to efficiently allocate IP addresses.
Network Segmentation: Connected network segments with routers for optimized data flow and communication.
Testing and Validation: Performed extensive simulations to test and validate network performance and security.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Cisco Packet Tracer: This project requires Cisco Packet Tracer for network simulation. Ensure you have it installed on your machine.
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/company-network-design.git](https://github.com/fah49/Company-Network-Design.git)
Open the Project

Launch Cisco Packet Tracer.
Open the company_network_design.pkt file located in the repository.
Review the Network Design

Explore the network topology, including routers, switches, PCs, and the configuration of DHCP and DNS servers.
Review the subnetting scheme and security configurations.
Usage
Simulate Network Performance

Use Packet Tracer's simulation mode to test network performance.
Verify dynamic IP allocation and domain name resolution.
Test connectivity between different network segments.
Validate Security Measures

Check for proper implementation of security measures.
Ensure that network resources are protected from unauthorized access.
Modify and Extend

Feel free to modify the network design or extend it according to your needs.
You can add new devices, change configurations, or update security settings.
Configuration Details
DHCP Configuration: Configured to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices in each department.
DNS Configuration: Set up for domain name resolution across the network.
Security Measures: Implemented access control lists (ACLs), firewalls, and other security protocols to safeguard network resources.
Subnetting Details: The network has been subnetted to efficiently use IP address space and segment traffic appropriately.
Testing
Performance Tests: Conducted simulations to ensure network efficiency and proper data flow.
Security Tests: Verified the effectiveness of security measures and ensured that unauthorized access is prevented.
